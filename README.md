## How to Run

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Run Composer install / update if any errror appear
- Run php artisan serve
- access the site using the url given after "php artisan serve"

## First Task
Programming Test to create card distribution.

It takes me about 1 and half day to finish it.

## Second Task
SQL Script, This task i'm not sure how to help with this but I tried my best to give suggestion and help. It took me about 30 min - 1 hour to write a suggestion.

There are several ways to improve the performance of this SQL query. Below are some suggestions:

1. Use indexes: Indexes can help to speed up the retrieval of data by creating a sorted list of values that can be quickly searched. You can create indexes on the columns that are frequently used in the WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses of the query.

Details can be found in this file https://github.com/hazreemahmood/card-distribution/blob/main/resources/views/query.sql on this url.

If you have any question do let me know.

Thank you.
